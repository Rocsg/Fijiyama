Find you way in the package
***************************

Fijiyama package contains the interface for Fijiyama plugin (https://imagej.net/Fijiyama) and the registration manager used to pipeline registration sequences
The plugin is roughly structured following the MVC pattern
- Fijiyama_GUI is the GUI of the plugin, hosting the frame definition, buttons, and associated actionPerformed
- RegistrationAction is a small object used to hold parameters of an action of registration between two images
- RegistrationManager is partly model and controller of the plugin : it manages data reading and action sequencing
- ScrollUtil is a helper class found on the web, useful to scroll a JScrollPane to the current object, or to the bottom of the list


TODO : Best split of functions : set the runnables and manual registration interfaces in RegistrationAction
TODO : during Programming, only MAN and AUTO actions should be available
TODO : when loading, the first action after becomes MAN
